# apple-playlist-downloader 🎵

[✔️ Working as of 30-08-2023]

1. Open cmd/console
2. Clone repo - `git clone https://github.com/Shubhamrawat5/apple-playlist-downloader.git`
3. Open directory - `cd apple-playlist-downloader`
4. Install all dependencies - `npm install`
5. Now edit playlist url variable and set your playlist link in file `app.js [line 10]`
6. Run `npm start`

- Now a folder "songs" will be created.
- Playlist info will be extract and all the matching songs will start donwloading!
- It'll not download same song again if you rerun the code, So if any song is half downloaded then you can delete it from songs folder.
- Also there is 5% chance that song's some remix or different same name song will get downloaded... I'll be fixing this soon !
